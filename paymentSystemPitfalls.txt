1) implemented singleton structure as comfortable using it with swiftui

2) try await product.products within the purchase() fxn (we can cut out the extra param)

3) print statements show that the result we are getting is successful, obvious the way the db is updating isPremium

4) updateListenerTask commenting it out from the beginning, maybe it can run AFTER purchase let's see

5) moving updateProductStatus() to the end of the fxn
